# Multi-stage build:
#   1. `frontend`   — Node 20 builds the React/Vite SPA into frontend/dist.
#   2. `backend`    — Debian-slim Python 3.13 + uv, syncs the locked deps
#                     into /app/.venv. uv binary is mixed in from
#                     ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv (recommended pattern — keeps
#                     the python image clean and uses the official uv
#                     release without a `pip install`).
#   3. final stage  — runtime image. Copies `.venv` from `backend` and
#                     `frontend/dist` from `frontend`, plus the backend
#                     source. Entry runs gunicorn with 1 worker (the
#                     per-pod in-process caches require 1 worker until
#                     a redis backing layer arrives — multiple workers
#                     would each maintain a separate cache and fan out
#                     CAVE fetches unpredictably).

#                             time, faster cold start in the runtime.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Flask API + React/TypeScript SPA for browsing CAVE (Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine) connectivity. The legacy three-Dash-app layout (`connectivity_table` / `cell_type_table` / `cell_type_connectivity`) was replaced by a single workspace SPA backed by one API service.

- `dash_connectivity_viewer/api/` — Flask backend.
- `frontend/` — Vite + React + TypeScript SPA.

The package name `dash_connectivity_viewer` is historical; the runtime no longer depends on Dash.

## Running

```bash
# Backend (uv-managed; auto-discovers DCV_DATASTACK_CONFIG_DIR for datastack YAMLs).
# AirPlay squats on port 5000 — use 5001 locally.
DCV_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1 DCV_PORT=5001 uv run python run_api.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # vite dev server
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build
```

`DCV_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1` skips middle-auth-client so a local dev environment doesn't need a CAVE token in cookies; production must run without it. Datastack YAMLs live in `dash_connectivity_viewer/api/datastacks/` (bundled) and additional ones can be loaded from `DCV_DATASTACK_CONFIG_DIR`.

There are no automated tests yet. The dev workflow is to start the API + SPA and exercise it in a browser against `minnie65_public`.

## Architecture

### Backend: `dash_connectivity_viewer/api/`

`create_app()` in `api/__init__.py` builds a Flask app with:
- `middle_auth_client` decorators (Tourguide-pattern) on every endpoint, except when `DCV_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1`
- a custom `NumpyJSONProvider` that handles numpy scalars and `pd.NA` (a `pd.NA → None` rule was added because pandas nullable dtypes leak into JSON otherwise)
- per-pod in-process caches (`api/caches.py`); horizontal scaling expects sticky-session ingress for the synapse cache and a `PeriodicWarmer` for reference tables (see `services/warmup.py`)

Endpoints live in `api/endpoints/`:
- `datastacks.py` — datastack list, info, materialization versions, table list (live → tables only; materialized → tables + views, merged into one list)
- `connectivity.py` — `/connectivity` is the workhorse: returns `partners_in` + `partners_out` joined with optional decoration tables in one call
- `decorations.py` — `/decorations/poll` for stale-while-revalidate ticket completion
- `cell_ids.py` — bidirectional `cell_id ↔ root_id` lookup
- `links.py` — Neuroglancer state generation; reads `templates/links/*.yaml` (one template per link "kind": `inputs`, `outputs`, `connectivity`)
- `plots.py` — server-side Plotly figure generation; reads `templates/plots/*.yaml` (PlotSpec)
- `table_rows.py` — generic table/view paginated reads

Services in `api/services/` are the orchestration layer: `neuron.py` builds the connectivity bundle, `decoration.py` glues the SWR cache to the per-table queries, `links.py` materializes Neuroglancer state via `nglui.statebuilder`, `plots.py` resolves a PlotSpec into a Plotly figure JSON.

### Per-datastack YAML config

`dash_connectivity_viewer/api/datastacks/<datastack>.yaml` overrides synapse columns, aggregation rules, position-column prefix, cell-id lookup tables/views, and warmup behavior. Loaded via `services/datastack_config.py`. Adding a new dataset means dropping a YAML in this directory.

### Caching strategy (`api/caches.py` + `services/swr.py`)

- Stale-while-revalidate cache keyed by `(ds, mat_version, table)` for decoration data; the API returns stale data immediately + a poll ticket, the SPA polls `/decorations/poll` until fresh.
- Two ticket-readiness invariants worth remembering: (1) **freshness ≠ readiness** — readiness is `fetched_at >= minted_at`, not `freshness == "fresh"`; (2) revalidation closures must default-arg-capture all variables they reference, otherwise the cache reassign in the outer scope poisons every in-flight closure (this is the late-binding bug from phase c).
- `PeriodicWarmer` warms reference tables; `startup_delay_seconds` matters for K8s autoscaling — without it a scaling burst thunders the herd into CAVE.

### CAVEclient interaction

- Use `make_client_with_token()` / `make_client_anonymous(reason=...)` / `request_client()` from `api/cave.py`. **Never** call `CAVEclient(auth_token=None)` directly — silent fallback to `~/.cloudvolume/secrets/cave-secret.json` is a defense-in-depth hole.
- Live mode and materialized mode are distinct: `qf.live_query(timestamp, ...)` vs `qf.query(...)` are different methods with different signatures. Don't infer mode from `client.materialize.version`; track it via the request's `mat_version` query param.
- Views are unavailable in live mode and have no `live_query`. Enumerate via `get_tables()` / `get_views()`, not `list(client.materialize.tables)` (the latter raises a `TypeError` because the iterator yields ints, not strings).
- `caveclient` and `nglui` move ahead of installed versions — when checking API surface, look at the upstream master, not the installed copy.

### Frontend: `frontend/`

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + react-router v6 + TanStack Query + TanStack Table v8. `react-plotly.js` + `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min` are lazy-imported (`PlotPanel.tsx`) so the ~2MB plotly chunk only loads when a user actually views a plot.

Key conventions:
- **URL-first state**: every meaningful selection (`?ds`, `?mv`, `?root`, `?dec`, `?from` for breadcrumb origin, `?viz_<plot_id>` per column-bound plot, `?ct` for cell-type filter on table views) is in the URL. Sharing a link reproduces the view exactly. The `useSetUrlParams()` batch helper in `hooks/useUrlState.ts` is the right tool for two-or-more-key updates — react-router v6's `setSearchParams` reads at *call* time, so chained calls race.
- **Root IDs are strings end-to-end**. They exceed JS Number precision (2^53). The backend serializes them as JSON strings; the SPA never calls `Number()` on a root id.
- **Plot registry**: `frontend/src/plots/registry.ts` is the source of truth for the analytics rail. Adding a plot = appending a `PlotDescriptor` and dropping a YAML in `templates/plots/`. Static and column-bound variants are supported; column-bound plots auto-pick `barSpec` vs `histogramSpec` based on the chosen column's inferred kind.
- **Decoration is a parameter, not a page**. The SPA is one workspace with cross-navigation between tables ↔ neurons ↔ partners; cell-type filtering is a URL parameter, never a separate route.
- **Hidden columns** persist in `localStorage` under `dcv:hidden_cols` (user-hidden) + `dcv:shown_cols` (user-shown overrides for default-hidden columns, used by the Both partner-tab's directional aggregation columns).

### Connectomics-specific design notes

- The **Both** partner tab (unified view with `n_syn_out` + `n_syn_in` columns) is uniquely useful for reciprocal-pair analysis: filter `n_syn_in > 0` AND `n_syn_out > 0` to find reciprocal partners. Don't drop it in favor of the conventional dashboard advice of "keep populations separate" — the empirical workflow argument wins for connectomics.
- For "live" Neuroglancer links, the supervoxel-id-in-annotation-segments trick keeps links correct across proofreading; segment ids that come back from CAVE are root ids, but the chunkedgraph lookup happens in the viewer.

## Versioning

Driven by `bump-my-version` (`uv run bump-my-version`); `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth, mirrored in `dash_connectivity_viewer/__init__.py`.

```bash
uv run bump-my-version bump patch   # or minor / major; tags + commits
```

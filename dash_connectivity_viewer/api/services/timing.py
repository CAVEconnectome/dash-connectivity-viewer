"""Per-request timing instrumentation.

Why this exists: most of the latency in this service is spent in CAVE
round-trips (synapse / soma / decoration-table fetches), and the cost of
each varies wildly across datastacks, materialization versions, and
neuron sizes. Without per-stage breakdowns it's impossible to tell
whether a slow `/connectivity` request is bottlenecked on synapse fetch,
decoration enrichment, or in-process aggregation. This module emits one
structured log line per request with a stage-name → ms map.

Usage:

    from .services.timing import timer

    with timer("synapse_query[post]"):
        df = client.materialize.tables.synapses_pni_2(...)

Stages with the same name within one request accumulate into a list, so
two `synapse_query[post]` calls produce `[12.3, 11.8]` rather than
overwriting. Easier to spot duplicate work that way.

The Flask `before_request` hook initializes a per-request stages dict on
`flask.g`; the `after_request` hook emits a JSON payload tagged
`request_timing`. Outside a request context (e.g. unit tests calling
services directly) the timer is a no-op — it doesn't error, just doesn't
record. That keeps tests free of Flask scaffolding.

Logger name: `dcv.timing`. Configured at INFO with its own StreamHandler
so the timing line is greppable independently of Flask's request log.
Production deployments can override with their own `dictConfig`.

# Stage-name prefixes that count as "CAVE round-trips" for the rollup.

# CAVE-touching even though they share a prefix word — explicit suffix
# match keeps them out. Decoration queries are CAVE-bound but the SWR
# cache means they often warm-hit a per-pod dict; those short-circuit
# before any timer wraps them, so anything that does emit a

    Default behavior reads/writes `flask.g.timing_stages` — fine for code
    that runs in the request's main thread. Outside a request context,
    silently no-ops.

    `stages` parameter for cross-thread use: when work runs inside a
    `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `flask.g` isn't propagated to worker threads,
    so the default path silently drops the timing. Capture
    `flask.g.timing_stages` at the orchestrator (in the request thread)
    and pass it explicitly into worker code paths so their timings still
    flow back into the request log line.

    Repeated calls with the same `stage` name accumulate as a list —
    useful for spotting per-direction duplication or repeated fetches
    of the same decoration table. CPython's GIL makes single-key dict
    writes safe without an explicit lock; the read-modify-write for the
    list-accumulation case has a theoretical race that's vanishingly
    unlikely at our volumes (< few-dozen worker writes per request).
